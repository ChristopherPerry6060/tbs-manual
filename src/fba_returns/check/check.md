# Check

## Goals:
- Check the shipment
- Check the item's LPN
- Check the item's serial
- Check the item's function
- Check the item's value

## Overview
Below is a brief outline of the checks, additional instructions are provided
for each section on their related pages.

### Check the shipment
The entire shipment will be checked for the following
  - Missing Items
  - Unexpected Items 
After checking the shipment as a whole, the focus will change to individual items. 

### Check the item's LPN
LPN (meaning, License Plate Number) uniquely identify which order is responsible 
for the return. Knowing the order for a return allows additional information 
to be assumed.
  - Incorrect Items

### Check the item's serial
The majority of electronics have a serial number that identify the individual unit. 
Serial numbers are generated by the vendor, recorded, tracked, written on the unit,
and on the outer packaging.

When the packaging has a serial that does not match what is on the physical unit, 
we can assume it was swapped, or the result of fraud.

### Check the item's function
The final goal of this process is to resell the item in used condition. Certain items
require testing while others go through simple inspection.

### Check the item's value
Items that exceed certain thresholds will need additional confirmation to proceed.
