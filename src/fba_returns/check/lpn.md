# LPN

## Goals
- Identify items that differ from what the customer purchased.

## Incorrect Items
Each individual item within the shipment should be marked with an LPN sticker.
This sticker can be scanned into the LPN sheet to pull up the order 
responsible for the return.

Items that physically differ from the item that was purchased should be notated 
on the removal sheet.
